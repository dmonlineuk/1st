# First Install

Some quick-access scripts to get started with a new install

## FIRST

If it's not already part of the initial install (I mean, reading this locally without git??), then install some required packages:

```bash
sudo pacman -S \
    git \       # Obvious?
    firefox \   # Browser?
    bat \       # View text files the best way possible
    stow \      # Improves dotfiles management
    tmux \      # Improves tty/pts use
    vifm \      # Required for aurutilts
    less        # Required for `git diff`
```
